## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Flexbox and Grid layout methods are complementary to each other;
- Flexbox is one-dimensional, whereas grid is two-dimensional;
- Flexbox works from the content out, while grid works from the layout in;

### Continued development

- Make more projects using grid layout method to refine and perfect;
- Focus on using alternate syntaxes such as "naming grid lines" and "naming grid areas" for "numbering grid lines".
